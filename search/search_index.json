These constraints, applied to the architecture, were originally communicated by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation (see http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) and defines the basis of RESTful-style.</p> <p>The six constraints are:</p> <ul> <li>Uniform Interface</li> <li>Stateless</li> <li>Cacheable</li> <li>Client-Server</li> <li>Layered System</li> <li>Code on Demand (optional)</li> </ul> <p>The uniform interface constraint is fundamental to the design of any REST service. The uniform interface simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently.</p> <p>The four constraints concerning uniform interface are:</p> <p>Resource-Based</p> <p>Individual resources are identified in requests, for example using URIs in web-based REST systems. The resources themselves are conceptually separate from the representations that are returned to the client. For example, the server may send data from its database as HTML, XML or JSON, none of which are the server's internal representation.</p> <p>Manipulation of resources through these representations</p> <p>When a client holds a representation of a resource, including any metadata attached, it has enough information to modify or delete the resource on the server, provided it has permission to do so.</p> <p>Self-descriptive messages</p> <p>Each message includes enough information to describe how to process the message. For example, which parser to invoke may be specified by an Internet media type (previously known as a MIME type). Responses also explicitly indicate their cache-ability.</p> <p>Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)</p> <p>Clients deliver state via body contents, query-string parameters, request headers and the requested URI (the resource name). Services deliver state to clients via body content, response codes, and response headers. This is technically referred to as hypermedia (or hyperlinks within hypertext). Aside from the description above, HATEOS also means that, where necessary, links are contained in the returned body (or headers) to supply the URI for retrieval of the object itself or related objects. We will talk about this in more detail later.</p> <p>If a service violates any of the required constraints, it cannot be considered RESTful.</p> <p>Complying with these constraints, and thus conforming to the REST architectural style, enables any kind of distributed hypermedia system to have desirable non-functional properties such as performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.</p>"},{"location":"#what-is-developer-experience","title":"What is Developer Experience?","text":"<p>One of the key principles of good API design is that an interface must provide a seamless and user-friendly developer experience (DX) if it is to facilitate the creation of applications that add value to the API owner\u2019s business.</p>"},{"location":"Command%20pattern/","title":"Command pattern","text":""},{"location":"Command%20pattern/#problem","title":"Problem","text":"<p>Mapping CRUD operations to semantics of HTTP <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code> is easy.

It can be a change caused by updating the offers status as presented below:</p> <pre><code>curl -X PUT https://api.allegro.pl/offers/6546456 -H \"Content-Type: application/vnd.allegro.public.v1+json\" -d\n{\n    \"status\" : \"RENEWED\",\n    // all other offer fields ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>or this way:</p> <pre><code>curl -X PATCH https://api.allegro.pl/offers/6546456 -H \"Content-Type: application/vnd.allegro.public.v1+json\" -d\n[\n    {\n        \"op\" : \"replace\",\n        \"path\" : \"/status\",\n        \"value\" : \"RENEWED\"\n    }\n]\n</code></pre> <p>However, it looks as programming database systems from the 90's where an update of one field would unleash dozens of triggers with hidden business logic, to the surprise (and dismay) of the developer.</p> <p>Beside this risky programming style, you have to ask yourself the following questions:</p> <ul> <li>what if the given operation requires input data that is not present in the resources model?</li> <li>what if the operation is so complex that you must execute it asynchronously?</li> <li>what should be returned in response to PUT or PATCH then? how to trace the status of that asynchronous operation?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Command%20pattern/#solution","title":"Solution","text":"<p>All the above problems can be solved by using the command pattern that gives you:</p> <ul> <li>a verbose declaration of more complex operations in the system,</li> <li>a standard mechanism to trace the status of asynchronous operations,</li> <li>an idempotent way to execute this operation.</li> </ul> <p>To implement this pattern add a sub-resource with commands to your business resource, for example: <code>/offers/{offerId}/{command-type}-commands</code>.
